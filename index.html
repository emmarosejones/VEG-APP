      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <h3>What did you make? Why did you make it? <br>Who does it serve?</h3>
      <p> Veg is an app that encourages users to get in a habit of eating<br>vegetables. I made this app based off of my interview with Taylor. <br>She described how she wanted to build a habit of eating more <br>veggies. This app serves as a veggie tracker and encourages users to <br>get their veggies in. </p>

      <section class="problem">
      <div>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <h3>What problem does it address? <br>(This could be an internal trigger.)</h3>
      <p> Many young adults and several other age group lack eating foods<br> with nutritional value and health benefits. This app addresses that<br> problem by creating a solution for beginners. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <h3>How does the app address the problem <br>through its design and functionality?</h3>
      <p>The Veg app makes it easy to create a habit of eating vegetables. <br>The user interface is relaxing, fun and engaging to encourage <br>users to eat their veggie goal. The interface is easy to use and <br>offers rewards when veggies are logged. There are also statuses to <br>keep the user motivated and invested. </p>

    <section class="target-user">
      <h1>Target User</h1>
      <h3>Who is your user? What is the issue they would like to address?<br> What details would help you approach your app design?</h3>
      <p> The target user for Veg is a college student who lacks eating<br> meals with any sort of nutritional value that is looking to improve <br>their health by taking a small step in the right direction. </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>What apps did you look at? What did you read? What did you take <br> away from these resources and bring into your project?</h3>
        <p>Since the target audience for my app is college students, I <br>looked up the most popular wellness apps for college students and <br>based some of the user interface off of that. College students <br>have no patience and a short attention span when it comes to <br>waiting on something to load or if they get frustrated by the app. <br></p>
        </div>
      <div class="interviews">
        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <h3>Summarize your interview(s) â€“ What did you ask? <br> What did you learn to inform the idea for your concept?</h3>
        <p>During the interview process, I asked Taylor what she wanted to <br>improve on and if she had a long term goal. She was very <br>specific in the fact that she wanted to eat more vegetables because <br>she does not get enough in her diet due to the busy "college <br>life". I asked her what sort of things she would like to see on <br>the app and she liked the idea of having only your favorite <br>veggies displayed, a badge system to encourage her, and to make it <br>aesthetically pleasing.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <h3>What was difficult about this project? What were some obstacles?</h3>
      <p>I had health problems throughout this project so time management <br>was my biggest obstacle. I thought the prototyping was the most <br>difficult because it was hard to keep track of artboards.</p>
      <h2>Successes</h2>
      <h3>What works about the design? What are you most proud of?</h3>
      <p>I am honestly just proud I even got this done. As far as the<br> design aesthetic, I think it works well for the target audience. I <br>think that this app is something the target audience would actually <br>use.</p>
